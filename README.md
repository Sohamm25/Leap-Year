# Leap Year Checker

This Python script checks whether a given year is a leap year or not. It provides two alternative methods to accomplish this task.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Python script using a Python interpreter.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the script's prompt to check for leap years.

## Method 1

This method uses a `while` loop to continuously prompt the user to input a year. If the user enters "exit", the loop breaks, otherwise, it checks if the input year is a leap year or not and prints the result accordingly. It handles invalid input by catching the `ValueError` exception.

## Method 2 (Alternative)

This method is an alternative approach to check for leap years. It also uses a `while` loop to continuously prompt the user for input. It performs the leap year check using nested `if` statements. Similar to the first method, it handles invalid input by catching the `ValueError` exception.
